# Week 1, Day 1-2: Process Fundamentals

## Theory Section
## Key Takeaways

‚úÖ Processes are isolated instances of running programs with unique PIDs

‚úÖ fork() creates processes, exec() loads new programs

‚úÖ Process states (R, S, D, T, Z) indicate what a process is doing

‚úÖ Parent-child relationships form a tree rooted at PID 1

‚úÖ Zombie processes occur when parents don't call wait()

‚úÖ Container PID 1 must properly handle child processes

‚úÖ PIDs are namespace-specific - same process has different PIDs in different namespaces
### What are Processes?

A **process** is an instance of a running program in Linux. When you execute a program, the kernel creates a process to run that program's code. Each process has its own memory space, execution context, and system resources.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Processes are isolated from each other
- Each process has a unique Process ID (PID)
- Processes can create child processes
- Processes have owners (UIDs) and permissions
- Processes can be in different states at any given time

### Processes vs Threads

**Process:**
- Independent execution unit with its own memory space
- Has its own virtual address space
- Cannot directly access another process's memory
- Creating processes is more expensive (fork operation)
- Inter-process communication (IPC) is needed for communication

**Thread:**
- Lightweight execution unit within a process
- Shares memory space with other threads in the same process
- Can directly access shared memory
- Creating threads is cheaper than creating processes
- Threads within a process can easily share data

**Why This Matters for Containers:**
Containers isolate processes using namespaces. Understanding process isolation is fundamental to understanding how container isolation works. Each container typically has a PID 1 process, just like a system has init/systemd as PID 1.

---

### Process Lifecycle

The life of a process follows these key stages:

#### 1. **Creation (fork)**
- A parent process calls `fork()` system call
- Kernel creates an exact copy of the parent process
- Child process gets a new PID
- Both processes continue execution from the same point
- `fork()` returns 0 to the child, and the child's PID to the parent

#### 2. **Program Loading (exec)**
- After fork, child often calls `exec()` family of system calls
- `exec()` replaces the process's memory with a new program
- Process PID remains the same, but the program changes
- Common pattern: fork + exec to run new programs

#### 3. **Execution**
- Process runs its code
- Can be scheduled on/off CPU by the kernel scheduler
- Can create more child processes
- Can interact with files, networks, and other processes

#### 4. **Termination (exit)**
- Process calls `exit()` or returns from main()
- Kernel frees most process resources
- Process becomes a "zombie" until parent collects exit status
- Exit status is stored for parent to retrieve

#### 5. **Reaping (wait)**
- Parent calls `wait()` or `waitpid()` to collect child's exit status
- Once reaped, zombie process is fully removed
- If parent dies first, init/systemd adopts orphaned children

**Container Relevance:**
In containers, the main container process (PID 1 in the container's PID namespace) must properly reap zombie processes, otherwise they accumulate. This is why many containers use init systems or process managers.

---

### Process States

At any moment, a process is in one of several states:

#### **R - Running/Runnable**
- Currently executing on a CPU, OR
- Ready to run and waiting for CPU time
- In the run queue

#### **S - Interruptible Sleep**
- Waiting for an event (I/O, signal, timer)
- Can be woken up by signals
- Most common state for idle processes
- Example: waiting for keyboard input

#### **D - Uninterruptible Sleep**
- Waiting for I/O that cannot be interrupted
- Cannot be killed with signals (even SIGKILL)
- Usually very brief state
- If stuck in D state = usually indicates kernel/driver problem

#### **T - Stopped**
- Execution stopped by signal (SIGSTOP, SIGTSTP)
- Can be resumed with SIGCONT
- Used by debuggers and job control

#### **Z - Zombie/Defunct**
- Process has terminated but not yet been reaped by parent
- No resources except PID and exit status
- Shows as `<defunct>` in process listing
- Accumulating zombies indicate parent not calling wait()

#### **I - Idle** (kernel thread)
- Idle kernel threads
- Not relevant for user processes

**Viewing States:**
```bash
ps aux          # See STAT column
top             # See S column
cat /proc/[PID]/status | grep State
```

### Parent-Child Process Relationships

Linux processes form a tree structure:

```
systemd (PID 1)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sshd
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bash (your login shell)
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vim
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sleep
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ podman
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ conmon
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ container process (PID 1 in container)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ httpd
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ httpd worker
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ httpd worker
```

**Key Concepts:**

**Orphan Process:**
- Parent dies before child
- Child is "adopted" by init (PID 1) or systemd
- Prevents zombies from accumulating

**Zombie Process:**
- Child terminated but parent hasn't called wait()
- Takes up a PID but no other resources
- Shows as `<defunct>` in ps output

**Daemon Process:**
- Background process with no controlling terminal
- Usually has PPID = 1 (adopted by init/systemd)
- Runs independently of user sessions

**Container PID 1:**
- First process in a container's PID namespace
- Responsible for reaping zombie processes
- If it dies, entire container stops

---

### Process Identifiers

Every process has multiple IDs that identify it in different contexts:

#### **PID (Process ID)**
- Unique identifier for the process
- Assigned sequentially by kernel
- Visible in the process's own PID namespace
- In containers: PID in container namespace differs from host namespace

#### **PPID (Parent Process ID)**
- PID of the process that created this process
- If parent dies, PPID becomes 1 (init/systemd)
- Shows the process tree hierarchy

#### **PGID (Process Group ID)**
- Group of related processes
- Used for job control (foreground/background jobs)
- All processes in a pipeline share a PGID
- Example: `cat file | grep text | wc -l` = one process group

#### **SID (Session ID)**
- Collection of process groups
- Created when user logs in
- Associated with a controlling terminal
- When you log out, all processes in your session typically terminate

#### **TID (Thread ID)**
- Thread identifier within a process
- For single-threaded processes, TID = PID
- Multi-threaded processes have one PID, multiple TIDs

#### **TGID (Thread Group ID)**
- The PID of the main thread
- All threads in a process share the same TGID

**Viewing Process IDs:**
```bash
ps -eo pid,ppid,pgid,sid,comm
ps -T -p [PID]                    # Show threads
cat /proc/[PID]/status            # Complete info
```

**Container Perspective:**
```bash
# On host
ps aux | grep container_process   # Shows host PID

# In container
ps aux                            # Shows container PID (often PID 1)

# The same process has different PIDs in different namespaces!
```

# üß¨ Every Process Has a Parent ‚Äî But Not Always Bash

In Linux, every process (except the first one) is a child of another process. But that parent could be:

* a terminal shell (like bash, zsh, fish),
* a system daemon,
* a graphical session process, or
* systemd/init directly.

## üå± The Root of It All: `init` / `systemd` (PID 1)

When Linux boots, the very first user-space process is:

```
PID 1 ‚Üí /sbin/init   (or systemd on most modern distros)
```

Everything else in the system eventually descends from PID 1.

Example of a simple hierarchy:

```
systemd (PID 1)
 ‚îú‚îÄ gdm
 ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ gnome-session
 ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ gnome-terminal
 ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ bash
 ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ python3
 ‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ firefox
 ‚îî‚îÄ cron
```

Notice how Firefox and cron jobs didn't come from bash, but they still trace back to PID 1.

## ‚úÖ When ARE Processes Children of Bash?

Only when you start them from inside a shell session, e.g.:

```bash
$ bash
$ nano myfile.txt     ‚Üê child of bash
$ python3 app.py      ‚Üê child of bash
```

Or if you do something like:

```
bash -> ssh -> bash -> podman -> conmon -> your_container_process
```

Then yes, those are in your shell's lineage.

## ‚ùå When Processes Are NOT Children of Bash

Lots of situations:

### 1. Services and Background Daemons

```
systemd ‚Üí NetworkManager ‚Üí dhclient
systemd ‚Üí sshd ‚Üí user session
```

### 2. GUI Apps Launched from Menus

Clicking Firefox from GNOME:

```
systemd ‚Üí gnome-shell ‚Üí firefox
```

No bash involved.

### 3. Cron/Systemd Timers

```
systemd ‚Üí systemd-timer ‚Üí backup.sh
```

Not tied to any terminal.

### 4. Login Shells for Non-Interactive Sessions

e.g. SSH keys, scripts, containers.

## ‚úÖ So the Corrected Statement:

* All processes have a parent, but
* Only some processes are children of a Bash terminal ‚Äî mainly the ones you launch manually there.

If you run this:

```bash
ps -ef --forest
```

You'll see the full "family tree" and be able to spot which ones descend from bash vs systemd vs GNOME, etc.

## üîß About Shebangs in Startup Scripts

Ah yes, the shebang connection! Here's the key insight:

**The shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) tells the kernel *which interpreter to use*, but that interpreter becomes a child of *whatever called the script*, not some pre-existing bash shell.**

### Example 1: Systemd Service Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /usr/local/bin/myapp-start.sh
echo "Starting myapp..."
exec /opt/myapp/server
```

When systemd runs this:

```
systemd ‚Üí bash (running myapp-start.sh) ‚Üí server
```

The bash process is a *child of systemd*, not a child of any interactive bash shell.

### Example 2: Script Run from Your Terminal

```bash
$ ./myapp-start.sh
```

Now the hierarchy is:

```
gnome-terminal ‚Üí bash (your interactive shell) ‚Üí bash (running myapp-start.sh) ‚Üí server
```

Same script, different parent!

### The Shebang's Job

The shebang is just instructions for the kernel:

> "Hey kernel, when someone tries to execute this file, please run `/bin/bash` and pass this file as an argument."

It's equivalent to:

```bash
/bin/bash /path/to/script.sh
```

## üîç Tracing Parent-Child Relationships

Want to see the actual process tree for a running service? Try these commands:

### View the Full Process Tree

```bash
ps -ef --forest
```

or for a more compact view:

```bash
pstree -p
```

### Find a Specific Process's Parent

```bash
ps -o pid,ppid,cmd -p <PID>
```

### Trace the Full Ancestry of a Process

```bash
pstree -s -p <PID>
```

This shows all ancestors up to PID 1.

---

## üí° The `exec` Trick in Startup Scripts

Many startup scripts use `exec` to replace the shell process entirely:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# setup.sh
export MY_VAR=value
cd /opt/myapp
exec ./myapp-binary
```

**Without `exec`:**
```
systemd ‚Üí bash ‚Üí myapp-binary
```

**With `exec`:**
```
systemd ‚Üí myapp-binary
```

The bash process is replaced, so there's no extra shell layer taking up resources. This is especially common in Docker entrypoint scripts and systemd service wrappers!

# ‚úÖ What the Shebang Really Does

When you execute a script directly (e.g., `./start_app.sh`), the kernel looks at the first line:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

and uses that interpreter to execute the file's contents. But the parent process is still whatever launched the script in the first place ‚Äî not necessarily a Bash terminal.

## Example 1 ‚Äî Launched from Your Shell

If you run:

```bash
$ ./start_app.sh
```

Process lineage looks like:

```
bash (your shell)
 ‚îî‚îÄ start_app.sh (run by /bin/bash because of the shebang)
    ‚îî‚îÄ child processes‚Ä¶
```

Here, yes ‚Äî your login bash shell is the parent.

## Example 2 ‚Äî Launched by systemd

A service file like:

```ini
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/start_app.sh
```

Even if `start_app.sh` begins with `#!/bin/bash`, the parent is systemd, not a bash terminal:

```
systemd
 ‚îî‚îÄ start_app.sh  (interpreter: /bin/bash)
    ‚îî‚îÄ app binary
```

No interactive shell is involved.

## Example 3 ‚Äî Cron Job

```bash
# /etc/crontab
* * * * * /path/to/start_app.sh
```

Tree might look like:

```
systemd
 ‚îî‚îÄ cron
     ‚îî‚îÄ start_app.sh (run via shebang /bin/bash)
```

Again, parent is cron, not bash.

## Example 4 ‚Äî Container Environments

If a script is the container's entrypoint and has a shebang, e.g.:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["/start_app.sh"]
```

Then you'd get:

```
container runtime
 ‚îî‚îÄ start_app.sh (executed by interpreter set in shebang)
```

Still not tied to any login shell.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary ‚Äî Shebang ‚â† Bash Parent

* **Shebang** = tells the kernel which interpreter to use
* **Parent process** = whatever actually `execve()`'d the script
* **Bash is only the parent if you ran it from a bash session**

So your intuition makes sense, but the shebang doesn't make the script a "bash child" ‚Äî it just means "use bash to run this file's content."

---

## üî¨ Live Demonstration

Here's a quick mini-demo you can try on your own system that clearly shows how a script with a shebang behaves when launched in different ways.

### 1. Create a Simple Script

Create `demo.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "PID: $$"
echo "Parent PID: $PPID"
sleep 10
```

Make it executable:

```bash
chmod +x demo.sh
```

### 2. Case A ‚Äî Run it from Your Shell

```bash
./demo.sh
```

While it's sleeping, in another terminal:

```bash
ps -ef | grep demo.sh
```

You'll see something like:

```
user     13250  12980  0  ... ./demo.sh
```

Here:
* `13250` ‚Üí script PID
* `12980` ‚Üí your bash shell PID (its parent)

**So in this case, bash is the parent, because you started it from bash.**

### 3. Case B ‚Äî Run it via Cron

Add a quick cron entry:

```bash
* * * * * /full/path/to/demo.sh
```

Wait for it to run, then do:

```bash
ps -ef | grep demo.sh
```

You'll see something like:

```
user     14521   1100  0  ... /bin/bash /full/path/to/demo.sh
```

Here, the parent PID (`1100`) is **cron**, not your bash terminal, even though the script uses `#!/bin/bash`.

### 4. Case C ‚Äî Run it via systemd

Create a service file `/etc/systemd/system/demo.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Demo script

[Service]
ExecStart=/full/path/to/demo.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Start and check:

```bash
systemctl start demo.service
ps -ef | grep demo.sh
```

You'll see something like:

```
root     15710     1  0  ... /bin/bash /full/path/to/demo.sh
```

Parent PID is `1` (**systemd**), not a bash shell.

---

## ‚úÖ What This Proves:

* The **shebang only sets the interpreter** (e.g. `/bin/bash`)
* The **parent process is whoever launched the script**
  * If you launched it from a terminal ‚Üí bash is parent
  * If systemd launched it ‚Üí systemd is parent
  * If cron launched it ‚Üí cron is parent

**So a script using bash ‚â† a child of a bash terminal.**
