###  PID namespace isolation in action!
## Conmon = Container Monitoring
The conmon process belongs to the host OS. When we run podman run ngnix the conmon process creates a Subprocess with a PID for the host OS and a PID for the container itself. One PID for the host's namespace and one PID for the container's Namespace.
From the host OS we can see both PIDs. From within the container we CANNOT see both PIDs, we can see only the PID of the container's NAMESPACE. The subprocess that the host's conmon creates insider the container's namespace has PID 1. It is the creating process of the container. If conmon's PID (host's namespace) dies then the container dies too.

We can check this:
running in the host OS:
pstree -p | grep conmon
           |               |-conmon(15183)---mariadbd(15185)-+-{mariadbd}(15427)
           |               |-conmon(17938)---nginx(17940)-+-nginx(17968)

we see that for example PID 17938 of conmon process in the host's namespace creates PID 17940 and PID 17968 also in the host's namespace. One for the nginx container and one for nginx's worker.
From within the container of nginx PID 17938 does NOT exist. Instead it has PID 1 as it is the child process of host's conmon process that created the container. 
So, from the host's OS namespace PIDs are visible for containers but from the container's perspective conmon PIDs are not visible. In the container's namespace we have only PID 1

## HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT ? 
How do we know that the host's PID 17938 coresponds to PID 1 in the container's namespace??

The NSpid field only shows multiple PIDs when a process exists in multiple PID namespaces (nested namespaces).
# From host run: sudo cat /proc/17940/status | grep NSpid*
# From container run: podman inspect 7a2c --format '{{.State.Pid}}'
and get:
podman inspect 7a2c --format '{{.State.Pid}}'
17940
[dimi@localhost ~]$ sudo cat /proc/17940/status | grep NSpid*
[sudo] password for dimi: 
NSpid:	17940	1 --> the first number is the PID of the container seen in the host OS and the second number is the PID as seen from within the container.


1) From host run: ### sudo cat /proc/17940/status | grep NSpid*
this will give something like : NSpid:	17940	1
meaning that host's PID 17940 has PID 1 inside the container.
2) or podman inspect 7a2c --format '{{.State.Pid}}' 
inspect the container. 
The container can only see it's own namespace:
podman top 7a2c -eo pid,comm
    PID COMMAND
      1 nginx
     24 nginx
     25 nginx
    226 ps
 This is what namespace / container isolation means.

The Correct Relationship:
conmon (PID 17938) ← parent
    └── nginx (PID 17940) ← child (this is PID 1 INSIDE container)
PID 1 inside the container IS PID 17940 on the host - they're the same process, not parent-child!
Let me clarify:
From your pstree output:
conmon(17938)---nginx(17940)
This means:

17938 (conmon) = parent process
17940 (nginx) = child process of conmon

Inside the container:

nginx sees itself as PID 1 (not 17940)
It's the same physical process, just different PID numbers in different namespaces

To answer your question directly:
No, they are NOT in the same namespace!
bash# Verify this:
sudo readlink /proc/17938/ns/pid  # conmon namespace
sudo readlink /proc/17940/ns/pid  # nginx namespace

# Different namespace IDs = different namespaces!
The Key Concept:
Parent and child processes CAN be in different namespaces!
When you create a new namespace:

Parent process (conmon) stays in host namespace
Child process (nginx) is put into new container namespace
They're still parent-child, but in different namespaces

`HOST NAMESPACE:`
`├── systemd (PID 1)`
`├── conmon (PID 17938) ← in HOST namespace`
`├── nginx (PID 17940) ← ALSO in HOST namespace (visible to host)`
    `└── nginx worker (PID 17968) ← ALSO in HOST namespace (visible to host)`

`CONTAINER NAMESPACE (isolated view):`
`└── nginx (PID 1) ← SAME process as host's 17940, but different PID in its namespace`
    `└── nginx worker (PID 24/25) ← SAME processes as host's 17968, etc.`


## The Truth:

PID 17940 is the host's view of the nginx process
PID 1 is the container's view of the SAME nginx process
Same physical process, two different PID numbers in two different namespaces

Why the host can see it:
The host (running in the root PID namespace) can see ALL processes on the system, including those in child namespaces. So:

Host sees: PID 17940
Container sees: PID 1
Both refer to the exact same process in memory

Proof:
```bash
sudo cat /proc/17940/status | grep NSpid`
# Output: NSpid:  17940   1
#                 ^^^^^   ^
#                 host    container
```
This shows: "This process is known as PID 17940 in the host namespace AND PID 1 in its own namespace"

## OR DO THIS:

```bash 
dimi@localhost ~]$ pstree -p | grep -E "conmon|nginx"
           |               |-conmon(15183)---mariadbd(15185)-+-{mariadbd}(15427)
           |               |-conmon(17938)---nginx(17940)-+-nginx(17968)
           |               |                              `-nginx(17969)
           |               |-conmon(19831)---nginx(19833)-+-nginx(19861)
           |               |                              `-nginx(19862)
[dimi@localhost ~]$ 
```
# TO GET THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP TREE FROM SYSTEMD TO CONTAINER
```bash
pstree -p -s 19831
systemd(1)───systemd(5122)───conmon(19831)───nginx(19833)─┬─nginx(19861)
                                                          └─nginx(19862)
```
# FULL TREE 
```bash 
pgrep -a conmon
```
```bash
systemd(1)
  └── systemd(5122)  ← conmon's parent
      ├── conmon(15183)
      ├── conmon(17938)
      └── conmon(19831)
```
### conmon processes are not # direct children of SYSTEMD(1).
### SYSTEMD(1) has several SYSTEMD() children and some of them have Conmon children.

```bash 
echo -e "\nFull trees:"
for pid in $(pgrep conmon); do
    pstree -p -s $pid
done
```
### SEPERATION OF USERSPACES ROOT/ROOTLESS:

## Why conmon is NOT a Direct Child of systemd(1):
It's NOT because systemd(1) needs to stay alive to collect exit statuses. Here's the real reason:
The Real Reason: ## User Session Isolation
```bash
systemd(1) [System-level, runs as root]
  └── systemd(5122) [User-level, runs as user 'dimi']
      └── conmon processes [Your containers, run as user 'dimi']
```
conmon processes are children of your USER systemd (5122) because:

You're running rootless containers as user dimi
User processes belong under user systemd, not system systemd
Separation of privileges - your containers don't run as root
Session management - when you log out, your user systemd can clean up your processes

systemd(1) does reap zombies for its direct children
systemd(5122) also reaps zombies for its children
Each parent process is responsible for reaping its own children

### If Conmon Were Direct Children of systemd(1):
### You ran containers as root (rootful mode)
### You used sudo podman run

```bash
systemd(1)
  ├── sshd
  ├── NetworkManager  
  ├── conmon(15183) ← If this were direct child
  ├── conmon(17938) ← If this were direct child
  └── conmon(19831) ← If this were direct child
```


## The Complete Picture:##
1. Container's View (Strong Isolation):

✅ Container CANNOT see host processes
✅ Container thinks it only has PIDs 1, 2, 3, etc.
✅ Container cannot see or interact with PIDs outside its namespace
✅ This is true isolation

2. Host's View (Privileged Visibility):

✅ Host CAN see all container processes (with different PIDs)
✅ Host can kill, monitor, debug container processes
✅ Host has "god mode" - sees everything
⚠️ But containers are still isolated from EACH OTHER

The Key Point:
Isolation isn't just about hiding PIDs - it's about preventing interaction!
Even though the host can see PID 17940:

Container A cannot send signals to Container B's processes
Container A cannot access Container B's memory
Container A cannot see Container B's processes at all

Example with 2 Containers:
HOST VIEW:
├── conmon(15183)---mariadbd(15185)    ← Container A
├── conmon(17938)---nginx(17940)       ← Container B

CONTAINER A VIEW (MariaDB):
└── mariadbd (PID 1)  ← Cannot see nginx at all!

CONTAINER B VIEW (Nginx):
└── nginx (PID 1)     ← Cannot see mariadbd at all!


### Docker VS Podman isolation
 Docker:
dockerd (daemon) ← always running
    └── containerd ← container runtime
        └── containerd-shim ← similar role to conmon
            └── runc ← creates container
                └── container process (PID 1 in container namespace)
Podman:
podman (CLI - exits after start)
    └── conmon ← monitor process
        └── crun/runc ← creates container
            └── container process (PID 1 in container namespace)
The Isolation is IDENTICAL:
Both use:

✅ PID namespaces - same isolation
✅ Network namespaces - same isolation
✅ Mount namespaces - same isolation
✅ User namespaces - same isolation
✅ IPC, UTS, Cgroup namespaces - same isolation

Key Architectural Differences:

Proof - Compare them:

docker run -d nginx
### OR WE CAN SEE IT THIS WAY TOO:
## Podman rootless:
User systemd(5122) [user 'dimi']
  └── conmon(19831) [runs as user 'dimi']
      └── container process [isolated in namespaces, runs as user 'dimi']

## Docker (traditional):
systemd(1) [root]
  └── dockerd(daemon) [runs as root]
      └── containerd [runs as root]
          └── container process [isolated in namespaces, but daemon is root]



```bash
User (dimi) → docker CLI → dockerd (root daemon) → container
                              ↑
                         Runs as ROOT
```
```bash
User (dimi) → podman CLI → conmon (user process) → container
                              ↑
                         Runs as USER
```
# Check process tree
pstree -p | grep containerd-shim
# Shows: containerd-shim---nginx(PID)

# Inside container
docker exec <container> ps aux
# Shows: nginx as PID 1 (same as Podman!)
Podman:
bash# Start container  
podman run -d nginx

# Check process tree
pstree -p | grep conmon
# Shows: conmon---nginx(PID)

# Inside container
podman exec <container> ps aux
# Shows: nginx as PID 1
Same isolation, different "babysitter" process!
The Bottom Line:

Isolation mechanism: Identical (Linux kernel namespaces)
Architecture: Different (daemon vs daemonless)
containerd-shim ≈ conmon: Both monitor containers from the host

The namespace isolation you learned applies to ALL container runtimes that use Linux namespaces (Docker, Podman, containerd, CRI-O, etc.)!
